### Hi there 👋🏻

I am Xiaole(Kim) Guo, an avid beginner golfer⛳, an anime lover😍, and a proud Chiweenie owner🐕.

Coming from a dynamic industry like chemical engineering, I thrive in energetic and fast-paced environments.

Problem-solving is my passion and what motivated me to become a software developer. I believe in fairness, honesty, and taking the initiative to get work done.

I love learning new tech stacks and working with fun and talented individuals. If you'd like to get in touch, please [email me](mailto:guoxiaole@mines.edu). Also check out [my portfolio](https://www.xiaoleguo.dev/)!
